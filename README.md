# Build Knowledge Graph

If you want to build your own knowledge graph, run the graph_rag.py script:

python graph_rag.py 


if __name__ == "__main__":

    insert(CURRENT_DATA_PATH)

Make sure to manually modify the CURRENT_DATA_PATH to point to the correct data location.


## Configuration

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
You can purchase the API key at https://www.deepseek.com/.

Configure the OpenAI key by adding it to your system environment variables for embedding retrieval. This can typically be done in your operating system's environment settings.
